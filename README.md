## Final Conclusion
- During the analysis of sales performance between 2023 and 2024, a notable drop was observed in the sales of accessories in the Northern region. In 2023, a total of 151 units were sold. However, in 2024, sales dropped drastically by approximately 37%, indicating a significant decline in demand or distribution performance.

- Proposed Solution:
To address this drop and improve accessory sales in the region, the following actions are recommended:

1. Conduct Regional Market Research: Understand customer behavior, pricing expectations, and competitor presence to uncover root causes.

2. Launch Targeted Promotions: Offer region-specific deals or bundles (e.g., keyboard + mouse) and seasonal discounts to stimulate demand.

3. Strengthen Marketing Efforts: Implement digital and local campaigns to increase visibility and engagement in the Northern region.

4. Improve Inventory Management: Ensure adequate supply and availability of product in physical and online outlets within the region.

5. Boost Retail Engagement: Train sales staff or deploy sales reps to promote  accessories during device purchases.

6. Gather Customer Feedback: Monitor reviews and post-sale feedback to identify product or service issues that may discourage repeat purchases.
